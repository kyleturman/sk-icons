# Slack Kit Icons 2.0

Working on new scripts to help with automating the development of icons. Currently using a package called [icon-font-buildr](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/icon-font-buildr) to convert SVG icons into an icon font.

SVGs must be fully outlined for this to workâ€”no strokes.

`$ npm run font`
